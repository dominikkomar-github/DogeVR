# DogeVR

Doge VR is a VR dog simulator with gameplay elements where the player is embodied in a family dog's body, allowing the player to experience how it feels to be a dog. The experience includes quests, interactions, unique movement implementation and vision colour changes to simulate how a dog sees the world. This project was inspired by games such as Goat Simulator, Stray and Nintendogs and was tested on Oculus Quest 2. My technical parts in this project were to implement dog-like quests and create the entire game level aka the house, non-technical involvement had to do with planning the game as a whole, contributing to the ideas for player movement and deciding what the game level should be.
