# DogeVR

Doge VR is a VR game/experience where the user embodies a family dog that can roam around the house and complete simple quests to keep the user engaged. My technical parts in this project were to implement dog-like quests and create the entire game level aka the house, non-technical involvement was to do with planning the game as a whole, contributing to the ideas for player movement and deciding what the game level should be.
